                <ul>
                    <li>"Your input was integral to the success of the Authentic Contexts prototype. The team truly
                        depended on your expertise in the digital platform to help bring the vision of seamless
                        integration to life....Your leadership on this prototype helped the committee accomplish our
                        goals for the Charter: to help other see what culturally responsive Eureka Math products could
                        look like. Thank you for that and for supporting my growth as I adjusted to my role as committee
                        lead." Maureen Jones 7/19/22</li>
                    <li>"...your contributions on the A&E Team embody our core value of Ambition. In our Curriculum
                        Review teams' quest to create products that engage, teach, and inspire students we have come
                        across many barriers. One of the biggest barriers has been trying to show what authentic
                        contexts could "look like" without having the necessary staff and resources in place to do so.
                        You removed obstacles by moving ahead with the research, despite this barrier, and putting
                        together a prototype that helped our team see the vision. You acknowledged that the conditions
                        were not ideal, but also recognized that if our team didn't make an attempt to illustrate
                        culturally responsive contexts, it likely wouldn't get done. You also helped the team move
                        forward, ensuring we achieved the expectations set for the assignment, by making a checklist of
                        tasks to be accomplished and keeping the team on track at a pivotal time Additionally, there are
                        so many other ways that you contribute to this team:
                        -you volunteer to take on tasks
                        -you share helpful resources as you come across them
                        -you share knowledge and perspectives that elevate our discussions
                        -you make connections to how digital elements can enhance the work
                        It has been great to learn alongside you on this team.” Maureen Jones 3/16/2022</li>
                    <li>“You exemplify the value of ADVOCACY in both the DEI and OMO projects. You care deeply about
                        producing the very best possible products to help students learn math. You craft DIs that help
                        students see how and why the math is important in their world. You care deeply about helping
                        teachers craft and hone their practice. This is evident in the comments you make that reflect
                        wanting teachers to learn and grow but also giving them proper supports. You present ideas that
                        other teammates often overlook or don't think about. This is something I value in our
                        collaborations. I can bring an idea to the table and count on you to make a suggestion that
                        takes it to the next level. You bring valuable ideas and unique perspectives to projects because
                        of your vast knowledge and experience with teaching, ed tech, world views/knowledge, and of
                        course, mathematics. You have kept our DEI group grounded and helped me personally to reflect on
                        new ideas and dig deeper through your knowledge about so many cultures.” Victoria Peacock

                    <li>“I have enjoyed learning alongside you on the Access & Equity Committee. As a member of the
                        committee, you are demonstrating our GM core value challenge. As you evaluate the curriculum and
                        make recommendations for improvement, you are exemplifying one of the behaviors that our team
                        strives for related to this value. Specifically, you identify new ways to make products more
                        accessible, engaging, coherent, and equitable. I’m excited for the future of EM products and
                        services as a result of the teams' efforts.
                        I also appreciate you taking on additional responsibilities when needed, a behavior indicative
                        of our core value ambition. You enthusiastically took on the task of team notetaker numerous
                        times during our committee check in meetings. You also graciously accepted the role of data guru
                        for our team. I am personally grateful for your help. On a larger scale, your willingness to
                        step up has benefitted the entire committee. Your commitment to the team and this work is so
                        appreciated.” Maureen Jones 10/20/2021
