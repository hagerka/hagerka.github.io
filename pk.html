                            <li>"Kim's contributions to the pre-k curriculum are numerous and essential to
                                supporting students' path toward greatness....Kim has made significant contributions
                                to the pre-k curriculum that improve the learning experience for students and the
                                teaching experience for teachers. She also supports the team in thinking of access
                                and equity as we develop lessons, applets, math pasts and artwork ideas. I have
                                learned a lot from working with Kim as an integral member of the pre-K team, I wish
                                we had the same opportunity as we were writing EM2-Grade 2." Beth Barnes 4/11/22

                            <li>"With your creative vision and collaboration, the PreK curriculum is going to offer
                                so many wonderful digital interactives for students and teachers. You do a great job
                                with finding ways to make the lessons more accessible and engaging through the use
                                of digital interactives." Stephanie DeGuilio 3/1/22

                            <li>“Kim - I just had a chance to review the PK-5 Digital Interactives Norms,
                                Procedures, and Expectations document you shared with the team during last week's
                                training. This document answers so many of the questions I had as a GK ME - I'm
                                thrilled that the PK/TK team has the document and YOU to better understand how to
                                include DI in the work. Thanks for making the process work better!” Kate Austin

                            <li>“I just wanted to take a moment to honor your perseverance in advocating for artwork
                                that gives voice to marginalized groups and provides windows for our youngest
                                learners in the PK space. I can seeking to implement the ideas from the Equity and
                                Access committee, specifically the Dismantling Racism series, and taking action by
                                asking questions that de-center whiteness and able-bodied learners. In Pre-K you
                                gently challenged the team to consider other cultures and perspectives through
                                Esther Mahlangu's art. I'm grateful to be doing this work alongside you!” MJ Weiland

                            <li>“ I really appreciate your willingness to throw ideas out there when you've got a
                                potential digital interactive in mind for PK. I think the lens you bring to our
                                brainstorming is unique to the group and has quickly become a necessary component of
                                our process. I think you've displayed the core values of advocacy and curiosity in
                                spades.” John Reynolds 9/3/2021</li>
