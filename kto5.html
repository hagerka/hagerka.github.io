                    <ul>
                        <li>Started K-5 working under Scott and Richard</li>
                        <li>Initially worked to create applets that Scott ideated in grades 3 and 4</li>
                        <li>Applets were often based on ideas from writers</li>
                        <li>In G4 and 5, differentiated myself and took control of K-5 during the G5 writing process
                        </li>
                        <li>Created progressively more complex applets, moving from strict digital model replication
                            to more creative applets of my own design</li>
                        <li>Due to the popularity of the applets from G4 and G5, retroactively created applets for
                            K-2, some of which made it into the TE, others missed the cut offs because production
                            timelines had already been created</li>
                        <li>Documented and maintained databases of K-5 demos</li>
                        <li>Became go-to person for questions related to K-5 demos, their capabilities, and their
                            uses</li>

                        <li>"Grade 1: The wordless videos and digital interactives are being well received by the
                            students.
                            They are frequent enough that students look forward to them, but not so often that students
                            expect them. Grade 4: The slides and digital interactives/videos are very popular with
                            students
                            and provide solid landing points for students that drive discussion."" Pilot Teachers from

                        <li>“I truly appreciate all that you've done, and continue to do, for grade 3 and grade 4. You
                            have
                            the ability to take ideas and, based on those ideas, create interactives that will be useful
                            to
                            both teachers and students. You are always super responsive to Slack messages and are also
                            flexible about meeting times.” Mary Swanson 3/19/21
                        </li>
                        <li>“Thank you for all the wonderful work you did for G5! I really admire your creativity and
                            programming ability. There were times I was unsure about how something might work, or if it
                            was
                            even possible, and then you would do your magic and voila!
                            You were always quick to get back to me and never hesitated to hop on a call to discuss an
                            idea
                            and how it could work best in a lesson. We all were working on an extremely tight schedule,
                            but
                            you designed interactives and made updates quickly which made it easier for me to
                            incorporate
                            into my edit window for the TE. Not only did you give me ideas about what we could do with
                            an
                            interactive (such as clicking vertices, edges, faces of a right rectangular prism), you also
                            were honest about what we could not do, or when something might not be the best for a
                            digital
                            interactive (such as the bar graph and coordinate plane in the left/right lesson).
                            I loved your excitement and enthusiasm to share interactives you were working on during
                            stand-ups even if it was not necessarily for a lesson I was writing. It was helpful to see
                            the
                            features of the various interactives and have an opportunity to ask questions and give
                            feedback.
                            You always displayed a positive attitude, even when there were requested changes or when
                            there
                            were cuts (fly high our dear fly friend).
                            You were also helpful in answering my Geogebra questions. Even when I moved to a new project
                            and
                            sent you a question about making a net of a cone, you not only paused your own work to
                            figure it
                            out, you created something allowing me to easily change dimensions…and then revised it
                            because
                            it wasn’t perfect…all in a matter of minutes! Rock star!
                            Needless to say, I really enjoyed getting to work with you and learn some things along the
                            way.
                            Thanks again for all of your help. I hope we get to work together again on future projects!”

                        <li>“I just wanted to say how fantastic it has been to work with you on the grade 5 team. Your
                            digital interactives are creative and engaging. They do an excellent job of demonstrating
                            the
                            concepts we want students to learn. You are responsive to feedback and always willing to
                            make
                            changes to applets. You come to all of our meetings to stay informed about what's happening,
                            which clearly demonstrates your dedication to creating an excellent work product. Any time I
                            had
                            a question or a request, you responded immediately.
                            Thank you for all that you've done to enhance the curriculum. EM2 teachers and students are
                            going to learn so much from what you've created!” Janae Pritchett 12/24/2020

                        <li>“Thank you for being so responsive when we have ideas for digital interactives. I appreciate
                            that I can give you a rough sketch and you make it come to life. I appreciate your patience
                            in
                            tweaking features and functionality as we go along, especially when I trickle them to you
                            instead of getting all of our thoughts together at once. You are always so responsive and
                            quick
                            about creating an applet, working through a bug, or making a change.
                            I appreciate your willingness to keep things simple and enhance what we do on paper with a
                            digital version with applets such as the decimal area model and the many computation on the
                            place value chart, as well as creatively bring ideas to life with applets such as exploding
                            perimeter (I still need to come up with a formal name for it), classifying triangles, and
                            the
                            customary liquid volume conversions. It is great that you are able to come to some of our
                            meetings and can pick up on ideas like our need to illustrate the conversions without the
                            expensive materials in the classroom.
                            I am very glad to have you as part of our team!” Debbie Schluben 7/30/2020

                        <li>"During the Florida project, when the writing team needed digital interactives for a new
                            lesson,
                            you were quick to respond and help. You created two amazing, quality digital interactives
                            that
                            were exactly what we needed to bring the lesson to life for students. You completed the
                            interactives in a short amount of time, which helped us to stay on track with the quick pace
                            of
                            the Florida project. I appreciate that you asked questions and offered suggestions during
                            the
                            design process. You also offered naming suggestions, which helped me understand how to refer
                            to
                            each digital interactive in the written lesson. Your dedication to the team and to creating
                            creative, high quality materials for students is very evident in your daily work." Megan
