                <p id="purpose-statement">For the last two and a half years, my goal has been to make student and
                    teacher experience of mathematics <span class="emphasis">exponentially greater</span> through the
                    use of digital interactives. I challenge myself and my colleagues to make curriculum that is
                    accessible to students of all cultures, backgrounds, and abilities through my work on the Access and
                    Equity committee and my innovations in the creation of accessible digital material. I consistently
                    support and nurture growth in my colleagues by providing consistent feedback and offering guidance
                    whenever needed.

                        I take pride in communicating with colleagues in a clear and timely manner. I ask clarifying
                        questions to gather more information about teammates' perspectives, and use that information to
                        make informed decisions. I value the diverse backgrounds and experiences of my teammates, and
                        seek to incorporate those experiences in my decision making wherever possible.

                        am taking on
                        new roles, such as UAT lead while continuing to lead in the PK-5 grade bands. I am
                        discovering new ways to make digital interactives more
                        accessible, such as using haptic feedback, sonification, and keyboard-accessible
                        tools. I am ask for support from my colleagues and managers in order to create interactives
                        and lessons that make the our
                        Eureka Math products top-quality digital curriculum.

                        When making decisions
                        with my colleagues, I seek and support multiple perspectives by ensuring that the decisions
                        we make are positive decisions across all grade levels. I implement decisions quickly and
                        effectively, and support others by creating methods to make their work more efficient as
                        well. I frequently cheer on my colleagues by celebrating their successes and supporting them
                        in sharing out their learning.

                        I research advances in
                        educational technology for elementary students and share that research out with my
                        teammates. I share out information I learn to make sure that all of our accessibility
                        decisions not only make our products accessible, but they also make them usable and
                        enjoyable for students and teachers. I gather product feedback from grade level teams, DID
                        team members, sales, students, and teachers and implement changes based on that
                        information. I adapt to changes in roles and duties as our digital platform and projects
                        evolve.

                              style="color:rgb(130, 63, 152); font-size:24px">enlightenment</span>. I have been
                        learning about accessible web design for the past year for personal growth, and I have
                        enjoyed putting the skills I
                        learn into practice in new and interesting ways in my professional work. I used my web
                        development skills to devise
                        new ways to use the components available in the platform in order to make an engaging and
                        heretofore unexplored type of lesson for Integrated Math 1 students. I also used DOM
                        manipulation to accomplish accessibility criteria by allowing for aria-label
                        creation, assignment of role, canvas protection, and identification of focused elements. I
                        have collaborated with my colleagues to implement those changes into code that makes our
                        products stronger and more accessible.
