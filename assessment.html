    <p>Responsibilities
        Interpret assessment writers’ requests
        Create applets that accomplish assessment goals
        Remediate applets to be more accessible, either by implementing translations or WCAG criteria
        Accomplishments
        51 assessments created in grades 3 through 9
        5 assessments remediated
        3 assessments translated into Spanish
        Growth
        Discovered the difficulties in describing visual material in a way that did not give away an answer, which is
        especially important in assessment
        Learned to make suggestions to assessment writers to accomplish their goal while making it a more usable applet
        for students. For example, I originally created a sketch-based applet for grade 9 assessments, and I changed
        that into a fit polynomial experience so that students could demonstrate their knowledge in a way that minimized
        the amount of frustration with the software that students would experience
        Feedback
        “First, I really appreciate you stepping in and helping Richard out with some of the assessment items. I was
        truly amazed with how quickly you were able to create some of my g3 items! Not only were you able to whip off so
        many items, but each one was exactly what I was looking for!” Jackie Wolford 10/12/2020
        “Just wanted to give you some praises on your work on the A1 GGB activities. Thanks for being so responsive and
        demonstrating such an eagerness in developing requested activities. I appreciate your flexibility when it comes
        to changes and willingness to offer suggestions on the targeted functionality of the activities. You have been
        very helpful. “ Monique Colbert 8/28/2020
