                <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interpret assessment writers’ requests
                    </li>
                    <li>Create applets that accomplish assessment goals
                    </li>
                    <li>Remediate applets to be more accessible, either by implementing translations or WCAG criteria
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Accomplishments</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>51 assessments created in grades 3 through 9</li>
                    <li>5 assessments remediated
                    </li>
                    <li>3 assessments translated into Spanish
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Growth</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Discovered the difficulties in describing visual material in a way that did not give away an
                        answer,
                        which
                        is
                        especially important in assessment</li>
                    <li>Learned to make suggestions to assessment writers to accomplish their goal while making it a
                        more
                        usable
                        applet
                        for students. For example, I originally created a sketch-based applet for grade 9 assessments,
                        and I
                        changed
                        that into a fit polynomial experience so that students could demonstrate their knowledge in a
                        way
                        that
                        minimized
                        the amount of frustration with the software that students would experience
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Feedback</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>“First, I really appreciate you stepping in and helping Richard out with some of the assessment
                        items. I was
                        truly amazed with how quickly you were able to create some of my g3 items! Not only were you
                        able to
                        whip
                        off so
                        many items, but each one was exactly what I was looking for!” Jackie Wolford 10/12/2020</li>
                    <li>“Just wanted to give you some praises on your work on the A1 GGB activities. Thanks for being so
                        responsive
                        and
                        demonstrating such an eagerness in developing requested activities. I appreciate your
                        flexibility
                        when it
                        comes
                        to changes and willingness to offer suggestions on the targeted functionality of the activities.
                        You
                        have
                        been
                        very helpful. “ Monique Colbert 8/28/2020</li>
