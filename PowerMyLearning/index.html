                                    notes, notebook paper, or scrap paper.

                                    Shade one of the thirds. Write the fraction 1/3.

                                    they already made.

                                    of the total number of sections for each piece of paper. Have
                                    them compare that new fraction to their original fraction.
                                    3/6=1/2 and 2/6 = 1/3.
